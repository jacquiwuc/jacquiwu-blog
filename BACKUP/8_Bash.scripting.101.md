# [Bash scripting 101](https://github.com/jacquiwuc/jacquiwu-blog/issues/8)

### What is bash?

Bash is an Unix shel and command language. It is widely available on various operatng systems and it is the dedault command interpreter on most Linux system.

Bash stands for Bourne-Again Shell. As with other shells, Bash can be used in the terminal. The bash file is with a `.sh` extension, to create it, `touch` command can be used:

`touch test.sh`

Once we have our `test.sh` file created and we can open the file again and add the following:

` echo "hello world" `

Save the file and exit.
